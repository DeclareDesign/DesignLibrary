#' Create a two-by-two factorial design
#'
#' Builds a two-by-two factorial design in which assignments to each factor are independent of each other.
#' 
#' @details
#' Three types of estimand are declared. First, weighted averages of the average treatment effects of each treatment, given the two conditions of the other treatments. Second and third, the difference in treatment effects of each treatment, given the conditions of the other treatment.
#' 
#' Units are assigned to treatment using complete random assignment. Potential outcomes follow a normal distribution.
#' 
#' Treatment A is assigned first and then Treatment B within blocks defined by treatment A. Thus, if there are 6 units 
#' 3 are guaranteed to receive treatment A but the number receiving treatment B is stochastic.
#' 
#' See \code{\link{multi_arm_designer}} for a factorial design with non independent assignments.
#' 
#' @param N An integer. Size of sample.
#' @param prob_A A number in [0,1]. Probability of assignment to treatment A.
#' @param prob_B A number in [0,1]. Probability of assignment to treatment B.
#' @param weight_A A number. Weight placed on A=1 condition in definition of "average effect of B" estimand.
#' @param weight_B A number. Weight placed on B=1 condition in definition of "average effect of A" estimand.
#' @param outcome_means A vector of length 4. Average outcome in each A,B condition, in order AB = 00, 01, 10, 11. Values overridden by mean_A0B0, mean_A0B1, mean_A1B0, mean_A1B1, if provided.
#' @param mean_A0B0 A number. Mean outcome in A=0, B=0 condition.
#' @param mean_A0B1 A number. Mean outcome in A=0, B=1 condition.
#' @param mean_A1B0 A number. Mean outcome in A=1, B=0 condition.
#' @param mean_A1B1 A number. Mean outcome in A=1, B=1 condition.
#' @param sd_i A nonnegative scalar. Standard deviation of individual-level shock (common across arms).
#' @param outcome_sds A nonnegative vector of length 4. Standard deviation of (additional) unit level shock in each condition, in order AB = 00, 01, 10, 11.
#' @param args_to_fix A character vector. Names of arguments to be args_to_fix in design.
#' @aliases simple_factorial_designer
