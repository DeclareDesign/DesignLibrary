#' Create a design for mediation analysis
#'
#' A mediation analysis design that examines the effect of treatment (Z) on mediator (M) and the effect of mediator (M) on outcome (Y) (given Z=0) 
#' as well as direct effect of treatment (Z) on outcome (Y) (given M=0). Analysis is implemented using an interacted regression model. 
#' Note this model is not guaranteed to be unbiased despite randomization of Z because of possible violations of sequential ignorability.
#' 
#' @details 
#' 
#' See \href{https://declaredesign.org/r/designlibrary/articles/mediation_analysis.html}{vignette online}.
#' 
#' @param N An integer. Size of sample.
#' @param a A number. Parameter governing effect of treatment (Z) on mediator (M).
#' @param b A number. Effect of mediator (M) on outcome (Y) when Z = 0.
#' @param c A number. Interaction between mediator (M) and (Z) for outcome (Y).
#' @param d A number. Direct effect of treatment (Z) on outcome (Y), when M = 0.
#' @param rho A number in [-1,1]. Correlation between mediator (M) and outcome (Y) error terms. Non zero correlation implies a violation of sequential ignorability.
#' @param args_to_fix A character vector. Names of arguments to be args_to_fix in design.
#' @return A mediation analysis design.
