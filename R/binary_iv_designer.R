#' Create a binary instrumental variables design
#'
#' Builds a design with one instrument, one binary explanatory variable, and one outcome.
#' 
#' A researcher is interested in the effect of binary X on outcome Y.  The relationship is confounded  because units that are more likely to be assigned to X=1 have higher Y outcomes.
#' A potential instrument Z is examined, which plausibly causes X. The instrument can be used to assess the effect of X on Y for units whose value of X depends on Z if Z does not negatively affect X for some cases, affects X positively for some, and affects Y only through X.

#' @details 
#' See \href{https://declaredesign.org/r/designlibrary/articles/binary_iv.html}{vignette online} for more details on estimands.
#' 
#' @param N An integer. Sample size.
#' @param type_probs A vector of four numbers in [0,1]. Probability of each complier type (always-taker, never-taker, complier, defier).
#' @param assignment_probs A vector of four numbers in [0,1]. Probability of assignment to encouragement (Z) for each complier type (always-taker, never-taker, complier, defier). Under random assignment these are normally identical since complier status is not known to researchers in advance.
#' @param a_Y A real number. Constant in Y equation. Assumed constant across types. Overridden by \code{a} if specified.
#' @param a A vector of four numbers. Constant in Y equation for each complier type (always-taker, never-taker, complier, defier).
#' @param b_Y A real number. Effect of X on Y equation. Assumed constant across types. Overridden by \code{b} if specified. 
#' @param b A vector of four numbers. Slope on X in Y equation for each complier type (always-taker, never-taker, complier, defier).
#' @param d_Y A real number. Effect of Z on Y. Assumed constant across types. Overridden by \code{d} if specified.
#' @param d A vector of four numbers. Slope on Z in Y equation for each complier type (non zero implies violation of exclusion restriction).
#' @param outcome_sd A real number. The standard deviation of the outcome.
#' @param args_to_fix A character vector. Names of arguments to be args_to_fix in design.
#' @return A simple instrumental variables design with binary instrument, treatment, and outcome variables.
