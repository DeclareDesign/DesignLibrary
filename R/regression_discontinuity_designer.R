#' Create a regression discontinuity design
#'
#' Builds a design with sample from population of size \code{N}. The average treatment effect local to the cutpoint is equal to \code{tau}. It allows for specification of the order of the polynomial regression (\code{poly_reg_order}), cutoff value on the running variable (\code{cutoff}), and size of bandwidth around the cutoff (\code{bandwidth}). By providing a vector of numbers to \code{control_coefs} and \code{treatment_coefs}, users can also specify polynomial regression coefficients that generate the expected control and treatment potential outcomes given the running variable.

#' See \href{https://declaredesign.org/r/designlibrary/articles/regression_discontinuity.html}{vignette online}.
#' 
#' @param N An integer. Size of population to sample from.
#' @param tau A number. Difference in potential outcomes functions at the threshold.
#' @param outcome_sd A positive number. The standard deviation of the outcome.
#' @param cutoff A number in (0,1). Threshold on running variable beyond which units are treated.
#' @param bandwidth A number. The value of the bandwidth on both sides of the threshold from which to include units.
#' @param control_coefs A vector of numbers. Coefficients for polynomial regression function that generates control potential outcomes. Order of polynomial is equal to length.
#' @param treatment_coefs A vector of numbers. Coefficients for polynomial regression function that generates treatment potential outcomes. Order of polynomial is equal to length.
#' @param poly_reg_order Integer greater than or equal to 1. Order of the polynomial regression used to estimate the jump at the cutoff.
#' @param args_to_fix A character vector. Names of arguments to be args_to_fix in design.
#' @return A regression discontinuity design.
